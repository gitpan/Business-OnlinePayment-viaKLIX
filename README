This is Business::OnlinePayment::viaKLIX, a Business::OnlinePayment
back end module for viaKLIX. http://www.viaklix.com/

Based on Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet written by Jason Kohles.
Currently maintained by Jeff Finucane <viaklix@weasellips.com>.

Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments
through online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses,
etc.  (If you like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform
ecommerce-enabling middleware solution").

You should be aware that portions of "make test" which interact with
viaKLIX will fail if you configure your virtual terminal to require
fields the tester does not expect to be required.  The documentation
specifies that ssl_merchant_id, ssl_pin, ssl_transaction_type, and
ssl_amount are required.  All others are optional.  You will probably
need to set ssl_user_id via the environment as well, since viaKLIX
recommends not using the administrative login.
